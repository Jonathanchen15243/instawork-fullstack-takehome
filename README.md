Hi! I'm Jonathan Chen, and this is my submission for the full-stack take-home assignment. I want to preface this by saying that this is my first time using Django, so I focused more on learning how to effectively apply the power of the framework, and less so on the html/styling of the webpages. 

How to build / test the project:

First, ensure you have django installed.

Then, after cloning the repository to your location of choice on your personal computer, navigate to the parent takehome directory in terminal. 

After making sure you are in the correct directory, run the following command:

    python manage.py runserver

This runs the code on your local machine, so that you can see what I created at http://localhost:8000/.

Thanks! Hope this gives you insight into some of my skills.
